#🌊 --algorithm
----level of thickness of singular wave 
----how far it reaches 
----how a weak wave or strong wave can override on top of another 
-----how fast it one crashes and how the other waves comes much closer and crashes and overried that (you can listen to it if you pay attention to it) and get sucked back into the ocean
-----how much time they remain in the beach sand 
----how you the some of the less reaching waves still remain even though the big waves have overriden a part but their footprint remains on the sand causing a wave pattern from aerial view 
----the gap being opening more the farther waves reach the sand
------the crash what does that mean.

------------are big things microcosms of the small things?
-----how are clouds☁️,mountains⛰️, and ocean waves🌊 the similar? 
what if all these things are intertwined in beautiful harmony together like a song.
